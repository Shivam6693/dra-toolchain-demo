template.description: "With this cloud-native toolchain, you can use DevOps Insights to gate the deployment of a simple Cloud Foundry application. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js weather app, or you can link to your own GitHub repository. The toolchain runs unit tests using Mocha, checks code coverage by using Istanbul. \n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-test-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain).~otc-ui813"
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. See results in the Deployment Risk dashboard in DevOps Insights. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-test-cloud-foundry-app-toolchain?task=2) for this toolchain.~otc-ui814"
